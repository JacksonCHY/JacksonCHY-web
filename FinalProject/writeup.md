## Background
### Who is Marco Polo?

In nowadays, people often reach to a consensus on who is the first European travel to Asia. Marco Polo, born in a 13th-century Italian merchant family, often regarded as the pioneer figure who have explored the uncanny East reach as far as China. Though Polo never claimed himself as the first pathfinder. Maffeo and Niccolo Polo, his uncle and father have once visited the Mongolian Empire in 1265 (Maraini & Peters, 2019). The journey to the Far East began in 1271 when the juvenile Marco turned 17. After four years of land travel, they finally arrived at the court of Kublai Khan, the emperor of the Yuan Dynasty. The supreme ruler showed strong interests of Western civilization and offer Marco a position of business ambassador. The extensive opportunities to travel across China and the neighboring countries over the course of 17 years allow him to gain acquainted with the cultural, ritual, ethnic of the Orientals. Moreover, his language talents also revealed by learning four other languages along the trip (Vogel, 2013). The Italian adventurer eventually returned after 15,000 miles voyage within 24 years.

### The book

Unfortunately, the war was breaking out between Venice and the city-state of Genoa soon after his arrival. During a sea battle, Polo’s fleet was captured by the enemy and throw into jail later on (Cohn, 2014). The Description of the World, more commonly known by the Travel of Marco Polo, was composed in the midst of the imprisonment. Polo’s cellmate, Rustichello da Pisa, a romantic writer was invited to transcribe the oral story into an old French manuscript. The book then became the first and most prominent account at the period for the European to study the oriental civilization.

Despite the detailed narrative of what he witnessed, some readers and historians continue suspicious about the story’s accuracy and questioning whether Polo has ever visited China. Several novelties such as paper currency, coal burning, and salt production have noted in the original work (Polo & Masefield, 1908). However, the story omits some everyday matters like the tea culture, Chinese Calligraphy, as well as the famous Great Wall (Wood, 2010). Skeptics presume that the Italian merchant may elaborate the tale from anecdotes heard from the traders who often conducting businesses along the silk road (Xiao, 2012).

The dispute of Marco Polo’s Journey provoked our interests to further delve into the historical mystery. 

#### *We are questioning:*
### **How does the academy community studies the Yuan Dynasty on behalf of whether Marco Polo went to China?**

## Research Objective and Methodology

In order to thoroughly address the question above, the research strives to orchestrate a scholarly discussion between the advocators and the contestants. To better illustrate a full picture of Marco’s adventure, our approaches coincide both literature review and narrative cartography. In addition to the Travel of Marco Polo, the Venetian, three other accounts we mainly examined are Francis Wood’s Did Marco Polo go to China?, Hans Ulrich Vogel’s Marco Polo Was in China – New Evidence from Currencies, Salts, and Revenues, and finally the Marco Polo and Yuan China by Ma Xiaolin. 

In terms of visualization, various mapping techniques enriched the story-telling experience. The result products including an animated itinerary (Mapbox), reference maps that marked about the Marco's stay in China (Adobe Illustrator) as well as an immersive reality model of a conceptual Yuan settlement (A-Frame). These diverse cartographic representations and narrations not only contribute to audiences’ interpretations of the ancient places but a chance to investigate the reliability of Marco Polo’s travel.

### Chinese Cities in the Eye of Marco Polo

Zhuozhou, a town south of the Beijing with grandeur architecture and fertile soil as Marco Polo mentioned a few times in his book. According to his observations, many buildings are shrines and temples that served for religious purposes (Xiao, 2012). Most of the residents here were employed in the business and manufacturing sectors to earn a living. Head south of Zhuozhou is a city name Hejian which famous for the production of the (golden) silk. Marco found out that majority of the silk products were to serve to markets in the capital via the well-developed canal system.

The capital of the Mongolian Empire (Yuan) known as Hanbali, is situated in today’s Beijing. Kublai Khan would spend his falls and winters days at his magnificence palace. The Italian adventurer was astonishing by its extraordinary architecture and landscaping. The court is fenced with two layers of 25 feet tall walls, had an artificial hill and ponds, storing precious jewels and treasures as well as domesticating deers in the royal courtyard. Marco Polo also recorded the tremendous trades occurred in the capital (Polo & Masefield, 1908). Merchandises from across the continent could be found and sold in markets.

The Travels of Marco Polo also described several cities in the kingdom of Southern Song (Today's South Yangtze region), which was conquered by Mongolian in 1279. He mentioned Zhenjiang was rich in sea salt, Nanjing was a big commercial city, and Suzhou had a flourishing silk industry, and there were Mongolian troops stationed in Yangzhou. In Marco Polo's story, he even held a government official position in Yangzhou city for three years, but suspiciously, there is no record of any Italians in local gazetteers.

The book spends 1/15 length on depicting the Hangzhou city. Marco Polo provided a detailed narration of water transport, the structure of ships, the market, people's daily life, and highly praised the town by calling it "heaven city." Notably, he paid attention to recording the city’s salt-tax. He is manage to give accurate estimate on the total amount of tax revenue generated by Hangzhou.

Under Marco Polo’s narration, Fuzhou was an affluent and prosperous city. Hunting activities were frequent due to abundance of bird species. The residents were lived by trade and craft. There is a river running through the center of the city. It was moored with ships loaded with sugar and jewels. In the book, Quanzhou was one the famous ports in the world, a large number of businessmen gathered here for trading.

Marco Polo’s description of porcelain appears to locate its origin in the province of Fujian. A question that raised by Wood about Marco Polo sited the production at the town of "Tingiu" (1996). He explained the preparation of the clay and depicted the ceramics were ‘azure’ (green) and ‘glassy’. It is hard to locate kiln source based on the color reference. Such type of green celadon was widely produced in southern China at that time. In fact, the location of the town is unknown, since none of the celadon production centres in the region has ever named "Tingiu".

### Controversy over Chinese Elements
This 3D map simulates the cityscape of Yuan dynasty by applying immersive reality measures from the A-Frame. We deliberately placed some symbolic elements of Chinese culture inside the model which are critical to examine Marco Polo's stay in China.
Now please going on the treasure hunt just like Marco Polo!

#### Tea

##### Against 
Despite considerable interest in the edible produce sold in Hangzhou's markets and the drinks and wines served at imperial banquets, Marco Polo never mentioned about tea in the book (Wood, 1996). Looking back to history, tea became the standard drink throughout China since the eighth century. Drinking tea has developed into a folk-customs of tea-making competition in the Song dynasty. Scenes of drinking tea and making tea are often depicted in paintings of the Yuan dynasty. It is difficult to imagine a stay of seventeen years in China without noticing the popularity of the tea.

##### Support
However, tea was not popular in the Yuan Dynasty, especially during the period when Marco Polo came to China. Before the establishment of Yuan dynasty in AD 1260, Mongolians never drank tea (Huang, 1993). In AD 1275, Mongolian royals at the first time consumed the tea from regions south of Yangtze River. However, tea drinking has not been popularized among Mongolians until the 14th century. Besides, compared to other dynasties of which have prolific writings for tea culture, Yuan dynasty barely mentioned the subject matter. Marco Polo, as a foreign merchant who lived in China between 1275 – 1291, spent most of his time interacting with Mongolians rather than Han Chinese. Thus, no wonder if he did not drink tea or knew little about tea.

#### Currency & Characters

##### Against
Although bank notes are described in detail as to its convertibility and relative worth, Marco Polo did not mention Chinese calligraphy on the paper money (Haeger, 1978). Since the use of coins was forbidden in Yuan, paper money became the main currency. The important information on banknotes was written in Chinese characters. Same as the bank notes, Chinese written system were widely used in Yuan dynasty even the country is dominated by the Mongolians. Its prominence presence in urban streets is attested by dozens of contemporary handscrolls. From this point of perspective, Marco polo seems to neglect one of the most crucial parts of Chinese culture.

##### Support
Although it is unclear whether Marco Polo noticed the calligraphy on the paper money, the situation of circulation of currencies in Yuan Dynasty supports the facticity of Polo’s journey (Hans, 2012). In the “Description of the World,” Marco Polo mentioned Yunnan used cowrie as the currency, and until he came into Sichuan, paper money was used. He frequently noted the paper money when he was in Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan, rather than in Fujian. That is because, until AD 1303, the governance of Mongolian was still tenuous in south China. There was always a significant amount of copper cash existing in the southern region. The circulation of paper money in Fujian is rather limited. Proponents argued that if he did not go to China, how could his narratives be that precision in coordinate with the Chinese historical facts (Ma, 2018)?  

#### Foot-binding 

##### Against
There are few references of women in “Description of the World”, but no mention of women foot-binding practice. This practice “became popular amongst the upper classes during the Song dynasty (960-1279) when small girls had their toes bent under the soles of their feet and tied with wet bandages to create a small, pointed foot (Wood, 1996). Friar Odoric Pordenone, who traveled in China from 1320 and recorded his journey in 1330, describes the foot-binding practice in Southern China. It does seem inconceivable that fashions could have changed so rapidly within fifty years that Marco Polo did not encounter bounded feet, however, the latter one who has a short stay spotted this practice.

## Conclusion

### Implication
In the beginning, our research intended to examine the findings of both the pros and cons parties to testified whether the Italian tradesman has ever visited the East. By setting up a stage for intellectual discussion, robust evidence provided in two sides offers us a glance into the dominant views on the topic. Perhaps, the significance of the Marco Polo is his pioneer role in bridging the cultural exchange between the East and the West by opening up the Mongolian, Chinese, and other oriental civilizations to European scholar, scientist, artists and power-holders. Despite the inconclusive answer to the narrative authenticity, he successfully raised the interest of Western society to explore more about the exotic East as well as intrigues successors like Friar Odoric Pordenone and Christopher Columbus to venture across the continent. Thereafter, the ambassador figure of Marco Polo overshadowing the travel mystery itself.

### Conclusion
Drawing from various scholarly accounts, the study achieved in construct an open-ended conversation on the journey of Marco Polo. Review of the three major literature allows us to understand major academic discourses about whether Marco Polo had actually left for China. Our analyses inquired the locations discussed in the origin work as well as cultural-significant elements such as tea, calligraphy, currency, and foot-binding practices. In addition to the text component, the research is further consolidated by implementing multiple cartographic techniques. We first created an animated map to illustrate the overview route of Polo’s trips; the mid-scale point-based maps give audiences a better resolution on which cities did Polo has visited according to his own account; last but most importantly, the 3D city model aims to restore the life and urban environment in Yuan Dynasty. Through utilizing several web-mapping tools, we are able to construct a vivid presentation of ancient China, and at the same time, incorporating diverse perspectives stem from academia in China and overseas into the study.
