Hello Classmates/Professor Bergmannn./World/! For the first time, we had self-learn to create a web-map and let’s give everyone a round of applause. Here, I have a map design for people who interesting in public arts. There are probably tens of thousands public arts within City of Vancouver. However, it requires multiple personnel and consistent efforts to construct a database for all the arts establishments (but if you want to see the city-wide distribution, check out the  [Public Arts Registry](https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/HomePage.aspx). My intention is to make a neighbourhood-specific public arts directory which can be publish on a community’s own webpage serving for local residents. I chose less popular/populated neighbourhood, the North East False Creek as the study area. It is the last stretch of the False Creek waterfront that have yet to developed, but the neighbourhood is undergoing rapid development in recent years. Users may curious the polygon features on the map. These are the land-use properties as defined in the [official zoning guidelines](https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/northeast-false-creek.aspx).
